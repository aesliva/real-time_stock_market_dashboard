**Why?**

This project started as a personal challenge for me to develop a full stack Java application after studying the Java For C# Developer's Handbook (https://www.vegaitglobal.com/media-old/4007/java-for-c-developers-handbook.pdf).
I also recently started investing in the stock market this year, primarily in ETFs, so making a stock market dashboard was a combination of a new interest and a challenge that I paired together.
To add on top of this, I decided to also utilize AWS services. In August I completed the AWS Cloud Technical Essentials course on Coursera and felt like incorporating a few AWS services would be a great way to solidify my knowledge.
It's been really fun diving right into this and working with many of these technologies for the first time, it's definitely been a learning journey that I'm proud of.
